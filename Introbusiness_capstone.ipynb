    "Milan is widely regarded as a global capital in industrial design, fashion and architecture. In the 1950s and 60s, as the main industrial centre of Italy and one of Europe's most dynamic cities, Milan became a world capital of design and architecture. There was such a revolutionary change that Milan's fashion exports accounted for 726 million US dollars in 1952, and by 1955 that number grew to US$72.5 billion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern skyscrapers, such as the Pirelli Tower and the Torre Velasca were built, and artists such as Bruno Munari, Lucio Fontana, Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni gathered in the city. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Milan is still particularly well known for its high-quality furniture and interior design industry. The city is home to FieraMilano, Europe's largest permanent trade exhibition, and Salone Internazionale del Mobile, one of the most prestigious international furniture and design fairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Milan is also regarded as one of the fashion capitals of the world, along with New York City, Paris, and London. Milan is synonymous with the Italian prêt-à-porter industry, as many of the most famous Italian fashion brands, such as ***Valentino, Gucci, Versace, Prada, Armani and Dolce & Gabbana,*** are headquartered in the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Numerous international fashion labels also operate shops in Milan_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the city hosts the Milan Fashion Week twice a year, one of the most important events in the international fashion system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for anyone wishing to be recognized on a large scale in fashion, Milan would be one of the places to consider. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have lived in Italy for close to two years and I have been very fascinated by the fashion industry all along and more especially after visiting Milan, whose energy is bustling high in this domain. So it makes a lot of sense for me to work on this as a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this project, I will be exploiting the neighborhoods in Milan, known as Districts, to find the most popular areas that would be good places to consider setting up a fashion shop or fashion industry, so as to get the maximum attention possible.\n",
